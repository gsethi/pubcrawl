Pubcrawl is an application that combines literature based semantic distances with protein domain interactions to dynamically create network topologies of terms. Often network topologies of gene names created thru pubcrawl resemble known biological pathways and can be used to characterize lesser known associations and identify novel data driven findings for further investigation. Pubcrawl is being developed at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, WA.
